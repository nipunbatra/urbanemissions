  "text": "December 14th, 2015\n\nDelhi announced a series of emergency measures to cut ambient PM2.5 pollution this winter season. One of the measures deals with restricting the on-road private vehicles during the day time (8:00 AM to 8:00 PM) from January 1st, 2016 to January 15th, 2016. Below is an infograph putting the intervention into perspective.\n\nWe assess that for a smooth transition to private-vehicle-free roads in Delhi, this intervention will require an additional 13,000 buses . To date, the Delhi Transport Corporation managed to assemble 600 of the promised 6,000 buses .\n\nDownload the infograph as a PDF or a GIF\n\nMail your questions to simair@urbanemissions.info",
