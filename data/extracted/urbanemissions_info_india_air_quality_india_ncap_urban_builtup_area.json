  "text": "Updated: March, 2023\n\n131 NCAP non-attainment cities are grouped into 104 airsheds. Of these airsheds, 73 contain only one city; 18 contain two cities, and nine contain three cities. Four airsheds – Delhi, Mumbai, Indore, and Chandigarh contain 10, 8, 5, and 5 cities respectively. An additional 33 cities, not on the NCAP list are also part of these airsheds.\n\nThe table below presents the percentage of 0.01 degree grids designated as urban based on the built-up area shares. For convenience, only the years 1975, 1990, 2005, and 2020 are listed in the table. The CSV file contains grid-wise fraction of built-up area for years 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 (midlong and midlat in the file represents the mid-point of 0.01 degree grids in the airshed). Details of the airshed grid are available here .  The built-up area layers are extracted from ESA’s Global Human Settlements program.\n\nDownload a composite of all 104 airsheds: here for 1990 and here for 2020.\n\nIndividual composites and animations (for 10 years) can be download from the table below.\n\nJournal Article on airshed designation process and monitoring needs (2023): here Journal article with review of NCAP action plans (2020): here\n\nin Vijayawada\n\nRajahmundry\n\nVishakhapatnam\n\nVizianagaram\n\nMuzaffarpur\n\nin Nalagrah\n\nin Pathankot\n\nPaonta Sahib\n\nin Chandigarh\n\nSunder Nagar\n\nHubli Dharwad\n\nNavi Mumbai\n\nin Kolhapur\n\nVasai Virar\n\nin Guwahati\n\nBhubaneswar\n\nin Bhubaneswar\n\nKalinga Nagar\n\nin Bhubaneswar\n\nin Chandigarh\n\nNaya Nangal\n\nThoothukudi\n\nPatancheruvu\n\nin Hyderabad\n\nin Hyderabad\n\nBarrackpore",
