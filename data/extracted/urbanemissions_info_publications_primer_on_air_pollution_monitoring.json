  "text": "Updated: April, 2023\n\nSaying goes, “we cannot manage what we cannot measure”. Having access to monitoring data is important for air quality management via (a) preparing action plans, (b) supporting public awareness activities, and (c) keeping track of progress in air quality (or lack thereof). Air pollution monitoring is a diagnostic exercise to measure air pollution levels in an area or at a source. This data over a long-term allows us to tease out diurnal, seasonal, and spatial patterns that support pollution studies and formulate action plans for a city. We put together a 101 style primer on air pollution monitoring, covering frequently asked questions and scientific jargon associated with the exercise. You can download a pdf version of the primer or browse the pages below.\n\nA blog piece published in 2018 on the same topic with pencil-doodles is available here .\n\nPrimer is also available in other languages [ Hindi ]  [ Telugu ]  [ Chinese ]  [ Spanish ]",
