  "category": "India Air Quality",
  "text": "India’s NCAP programme was launched in 2019 by the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and aimed at reducing ambient PM pollution levels in 131 non-attainment cities from 24 states and union territories. The first batch of 102 non-attainment cities exceeded the national ambient standards for either PM2.5, PM10 or NO2 for five consecutive years. This list was integrated with top 10 Indian cities on World Health Organization (WHO)’s most polluted list and some more cities showing an increasing trend in these pollutant concentrations.\n\nIndia’s NCAP programme required these cities to prepare action plans to reduce the PM pollution levels by 20-30% by 2024, relative to 2017 levels. In 2022, the target was revised to reduce PM pollution levels by 40% by 2026. Maharashtra has the highest number of non-attainment cities with 19, followed by Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in the country, with 17.\n\nFor all the NCAP non-attainment cities, this portal is designed to share available information on the designated airsheds on various topics. This database also includes emissions and pollution analysis conducted as part of our APnA city program.\n\nThese databases will be released in batches (Lasted updated January, 2024).\n\nGeneral Information for India’s NCAP Cities\n\nReanalysis (Weather/Meteorology) Databases for NCAP Airsheds\n\nReanalysis (Pollution) Databases\n\nPM2.5 Source Apportionment\n\nSatellite Retrievals\n\nEmission Inventories\n\nAir Quality Forecasts\n\nPublications and Other Resources\n\nPrimers on Air Quality",
