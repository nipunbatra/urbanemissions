  "text": "A short note inspired by this interview from Arnold Schwarzenegger .\n\nPollution, by any name — air, water, soil, or climate-related — is simply a contaminated environment that harms public health. Instead of treating these as isolated issues, we need to recognize them for what they are: outcomes of unchecked emissions from human activity.\n\nWhether it’s from transport, energy production, industries, waste management, or household fuel use, the solution lies in systematically cutting emissions at the source. Cleaner mobility options such as electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles must be promoted. If renewable energy is the most viable alternative to fossil fuel-based power, we must actively prioritize and invest in it. In the waste sector, preventing open dumping and burning, managing landfills, and tackling legacy waste are essential steps. At the household level, ensuring access to cleaner fuels like LPG and electricity, while moving away from polluting options such as biomass, wood, coal, and kerosene, is critical. Industries too must adopt cleaner production practices.\n\nReducing emissions across these sectors — through practical, community-supported action and policy alignment — leads directly to reducing pollution, cleaner environment, and better health.\n\nIt’s time to stop fragmenting the issue and call it what it is: pollution .\n\nAnd we must act decisively to eliminate emissions from all the known sources.\n\nTen Essential Air Quality Research Areas That Need Support SIM-air working paper series #62-2025 Download\n\nFive reasons why Delhi’s air pollution problem is complex SIM-air working paper series #61-2025 Download\n\nFive institutional reforms needed to support the fight for better air quality in India SIM-air working paper series #59-2025 Download",
