  "text": "March, 2023 : A review of Delhi’s air quality from 1990 to 2022 from data, sectoral, judicial, and institutional perspectives was published in Sustainability (MDPI) as an open access journal article . Air pollution in (urban and rural) India is a growing public concern, and city of Delhi (its capital) is one of the most studied city with a disproportionate share of media attention. Yet, we do not seem to have decisive answers to simple questions like how polluted is the city, what are the main sources, and where to start to control pollution in the city. In this review article, databases and story lines covered are the following\n\nGeography and meteorology\n\nChanges in ambient air quality (as PM2.5 concentrations) using information from ground measurements, reanalysis fields, and satellite retrievals\n\nSource apportionment studies\n\nSectoral history of road transport, agricultural waste burning, residential (cooking and heating) emissions, open waste burning, construction sector (including brick kilns), road dust, power generation and demand, and Diwali fireworks\n\nJudicial and institutional engagement\n\nAll the data used for these graphs and in the journal article is available here – https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7595760 . The databases and the documents uploaded here are the following\n\nAvailable ambient air quality monitoring data for Delhi cpcb_delhi_data_2006-2018-raw-cleaned.rar – This is CPCB data from 2006 to 2018 as raw and cleaned files. Raw data is at 15 min internals, which needs some qa/qc checks before use. The cleaned data is hourly. For data cleaning, all null points, all negative points, integer values equal to 9999, 999, 1985, 985, 915, 515, 1200, 1000, 2000, 380, 3800, 675, and 718 were excluded. These values were recognized after searching the raw data for patterns.
