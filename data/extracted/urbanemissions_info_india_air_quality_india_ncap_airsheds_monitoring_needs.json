  "text": "Updated: March, 2023\n\n131 NCAP non-attainment cities are grouped into 104 airsheds. For each airshed, we defined (a) the size of NCAP city airsheds (b) the recommended number of ambient air quality monitoring sites in an airshed (c) the operational sampling frequency to support receptor-based source apportionment studies. These resources are necessary for strengthening the monitoring needs of an airshed to track pollution levels, to conduct receptor-model-based source apportionment studies, and to support long-term air quality management plans.\n\nThe table below presents details at the airshed level on (a) NCAP and non-NCAP cities (b) minimum number of monitors recommended for monitoring PM, SO2, NO2, CO, and other pollutants and (c) an infograph with additional information on the airshed – size, built-up area share, total population, and urban population share.\n\nJournal Article on airshed designation process and monitoring needs (2023): here Journal article with review of NCAP action plans (2020): here\n\nDownload full resolution animation (of all 104 airsheds): here (or click on the image)\n\nBack to NCAP data repository .\n\nRecommended number of minimum air quality monitors for NCAP airsheds\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nHanuman Junction\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nRajahmundry\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nVishakhapatnam\n\nAndhra Pradesh\n\nVizianagaram\n\nMuzaffarpur\n\nDera Bassi, Parwanoo\n\nPanchkula, Kalka\n\nChhattisgarh\n\nChhattisgarh\n\nFaridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida\n\nGreater Noida, Gurugram, Palwal, Manesar, Sonipat\n\nGandhi Nagar\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nPaonta Sahib\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nSunder Nagar\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n\nBokaro, Jaropokhar\n\nHubli-Dharwad\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nDewas, Ujjain\n\nMhow, Pitampura\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nBadlapur, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Ulhasnagar, Vasai Virar\n\nKalyan, Karjat\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra\n\nPimpri-Chinchwad, Hinjewadi\n\nMaharashtra\n\nBhubaneswar\n\nCuttack, Kalinga Nagar\n\nNaya Nangal\n\nPathankot/Dera Baba\n\nThoothukudi\n\nPatancheru, Sangareddy\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nBulandshahr\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nUttarakhand\n\nUttarakhand\n\nUttarakhand\n\nWest Bengal\n\nWest Bengal\n\nWest Bengal\n\nBarrackpore, Howrah\n\n[Supplementary Material] 1.
